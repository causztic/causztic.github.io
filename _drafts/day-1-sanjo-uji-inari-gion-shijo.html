<p>Can't believe I procrastinated another week before deciding to post the second day! (I've also discovered I deleted the notes I created when we were in Japan. Relying on memory now..)</p>
<p>For our first day we decided to grab a simple breakfast from the Fresco store nearby and walk to Kyomizu-dera temple, as it was just nearby where we stayed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Afterwards, we headed towards Uji, which was famous for their tea. We went to Nakamura Tokichi Honten, and was greeted by a long queue. We wrote our names on a list and waited for our turn.. (I wrote my name as Yu-sama hahaha)</p>
<p>There were hot coals burning outside for the customers to keep themselves warm while waiting, and outdoor radiators too!</p>
