<p> As I went to write the previous post I went to take a look at the domain renewal for wordpress and I'm surprised it wasn't a one time fee!</p>
<p> So I spent 5 hours to learn how to use jekyll and hosted this on github pages instead. Imagine the savings! US$15 a year..that's almost a chicken bun a month!</p>
<p> But in all honesty, I quite like this. Onwards! </p>
