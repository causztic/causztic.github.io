The term break has ended and thankfully I was able to escape unscathed (for the most part).
It has been a short three weeks!
</p>

<p>I've replaced
<b>gulp</b> to <b>webpack</b> for one of my projects to allow hot reloading on development with <b>webpack-dev-server</b>. It also minified my scripts and compressed my images which you would have to write code for if you were using gulp. It also sped up the loading times of the project website which I'm rather happy with! I've also replaced the node server which also shows considerable loading speed improvements.

And then it's Guild Wars 2 all the way. Gained about 500 AP within 3 weeks and unlocked all the Magumma masteries! Made a new Austrailian friend in-game too; he asked for SQL help in game and I decided to assist. It has been some time since I've done MS-SQL and I really enjoy teaching him while refreshing my own memory at the same time. (It also reminded me how some modules taught in schools are rather poorly designed.)
