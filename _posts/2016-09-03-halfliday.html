<p>Studied extra hard for the finals and I'm happy I passed all the subjects! Whee.</p>
<p>Am doing web development on React/Redux/NodeJS for the holiday while getting back to Guild Wars 2. Also doing the smart mirror with Electron at the same time! This is gonna be a really fun 3 weeks of holiday (even though most of it has already passed as I'm writing this..)</p>
<p>I really need to finish my own portfolio too though..</p>
