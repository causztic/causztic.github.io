<p>
  So here's the deal: we wanted to create a shared authentication platform with Devise for both API and non-API (vanilla website) usage.
  For the API, we needed a jwt implementation, so:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>gem install devise-jwt</b></li>
  <li>update <b>devise.rb</b> for devise-jwt. Basically just follow their README and update accordingly.</li>
  <code>
    config.jwt do |jwt|
      jwt.secret = Rails.application.credentials.secret_key_base
      jwt.expiration_time = 1.year.to_i
      jwt.request_formats = { user: [:json] }

      jwt.dispatch_requests = [
        ['POST', %r{^/api/v1/auth/sign_in$}],
        ['GET', %r{^/api/v1/users/confirmation}],
      ]
      jwt.revocation_requests = [
        ['DELETE', %r{^/api/v1/auth/sign_out$}]
      ]
    end
  </code>
  <li>
    Update routes..
    <code>
      namespace :api do
        namespace :v1 do
          devise_scope :user do
            post 'auth/sign_in', to: 'sessions#create'
            delete 'auth/sign_out', to: 'sessions#destroy'
          end
        end
      end
    </code>
  </li>
  <li>
    Update <b>Api::V1::SessionsController</b>. We also needed to return extra information on successful login, so we also overrode the <b>respond_with</b> method.
    <code>
      class Api::V1::SessionsController < Devise::SessionsController
        protect_from_forgery prepend: true
        skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token
        respond_to :json

        private

        def respond_with(resource, _opts = {})
          if resource.email && resource.type
            render json: { data: { email: resource.email, type: resource.type.downcase } }
          else
            head :unauthorized
          end
        end

        def respond_to_on_destroy
          head :ok
        end
      end
    </code>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  Here comes the ceveat!
  <a href="https://github.com/waiting-for-dev/devise-jwt#session-storage-caveat">https://github.com/waiting-for-dev/devise-jwt#session-storage-caveat</a><br/>
  We had to either disable <b>session_storage</b> or <b>database_authenticatable</b>, which were not very feasible options if we were to also allow session-based logins for the website.
  <ol>
    <li>Disabling <b>session_storage</b> would allow JWT to not persist sessions even when no Authorization headers are passed, but would also remove the probability of sessions altogether.</li>
    <li>Disabling <b>database_authenticatable</b> would make the Users not have a email/password login functionality, which defeats the purpose.</li>
  </ol>
</p>
<p>
  (BTW the code mentioned in <a href="https://medium.com/@brentkearney/json-web-token-jwt-and-html-logins-with-devise-and-ruby-on-rails-5-9d5e8195193d">this medium article</a> does not actually work if your session happens to persist from the same origin as the author did not disable session_storage.)
  <br/>
  After spending a few hours scouring the source code (sparing you the trial-and-error details), I managed to have a hybrid authentication system by monkeypatching Warden's Proxy class:
  <code>
    module Warden
      class Proxy
        def user(argument = {})
          ...
          user = request.original_fullpath.starts_with?("/api/v1") ? nil : session_serializer.fetch(scope)
          ...
          end
        end
      end
    end
  </code>
</p>

<p>
  Doing this allowed Warden to bypass the session searching for API requests, therefore honoring the <b>Authorization: Bearer</b> tokens,
  while also retaining the use of <b>CookieStore</b> for session management on the website!
