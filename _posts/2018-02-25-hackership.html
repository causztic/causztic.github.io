<p>Well that was one hell of a weekend.</p>
<p>
  Just came back from a hackathon organized by a startup and I've learnt quite a few new things.
  The applicable problem statement is what really made the event stand out - 
  we developed a prototype that will be used to further their company's vision, unlike most of the other hackathons which I went for, which
  the product gets thrown into the trashcan at the end of the day.
</p>

<p>
  Anyway, the project's Rails architecture at first glance looked curious to say the least. There were no validations on the models and
  no renders of success and failures on the controllers. What was going on?

  A whole different architecture paradigm, that's what. <a href="http://trailblazer.to/">Trailblazer.</a>
