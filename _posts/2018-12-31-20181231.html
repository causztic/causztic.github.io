<p>
  The year is coming to an end, so I decided to (finally) write a blogpost..
</p>
<p>
  <b>Hackership</b>
  <br />
  Remember the hackathon? OpsManager, the company who conducted it, went and approached me a few months after, and I got hired to do freelance work for them!
  It is really fun to work in new projects with different structures, and they do have really interesting architecture and use-cases for the libraries they used.
  <br />
  <b>Hear65</b>
  <br />
  Hear65 was launched! Used Rails 5 and ActionCable for it. This was my first project in collaboration with a government body, to promote the local music scene!
  <br />
  <b>Summer - Drawing and Google Summer of Code</b>
  <br />
  Bought a drawing tablet and started drawing during the summer. Though at the end of the summer I started playing Warframe again and so I just kinda stopped drawing..
  and gained 700 hours game hours.
  My GSoC idea is being actively developed right now! Check it out at <a href="https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34788" target="_blank">https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/34788</a>.

  <b>Music</b>
  <br/>
  Music is a huge part of my life - I listen to it about half the time when I'm awake, and 2018 has been a great year for music.
  I made it a point to listen to a new singer every week, and purchase a physical album every 2 months to support the artists!
  <br/>
  If you haven't heard of Reol and are a fan of Japanese music, do yourself a favour and have a listen.

  <b>School</b>
  <br/>
  This term I took <b>Blockchain</b>, <b>Machine Learning</b>, <b>Networks</b> and <b>Southeast Asia under Japan: Motives, Memoirs and Media</b>.
  I figured it would be easier to understand blockchain with it being a module instead of self-learning it from the internet, and I'm glad I was right.
  We coded our own implementation of <a href="https://gitlab.com/ericywl/blockchain" target="_blank">bitcoin</a> and a <a href="https://github.com/causztic/archwing">Flight Insurance DApp</a> with Ethereum Smart Contracts!
  The Machine Learning module taught me the various state-of-the-art methods, and the History mod really opened my eyes on the World War 2 events in South East Asia.
  The Networks module was just a filler.

<p>
  Also made the plunge and now I'm a vegetarian for about 1 month already! 🍷 Here's to my determination.
