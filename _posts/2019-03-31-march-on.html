<p>
  I am really excited to start working full time to be honest! Just about 5 more months to go for my graduation..
  Handling freelance projects alongside academic ones can be quite challenging, but it somehow helped me manage my time better.
  <br/>
  Am now actively searching for one with passionate team members. Wish me luck!
