  Remember I mentioned about drawing more? I got back into Warframe and I started drawing less.. Here are some I've done that's not me practising techniques.

<div class="horizontal-gallery">
  <img src="/assets/drawings/vanessa.png" alt="vanessa" width="600" height="800" />
  <img src="/assets/drawings/Untitled-2.png" alt="untitled" width="800" height="600" />
</div>
<p><i class="image-caption">vanessa, untitled</i></p>

<p>Also, Google Summer of Code 2018 has ended! It really helped me understand how to contribute to the open source community,
  and to emphasize on code quality and maintainability, and ultimately making me a better developer.

  Have a read here if you are curious about what I've done for GSOC!
