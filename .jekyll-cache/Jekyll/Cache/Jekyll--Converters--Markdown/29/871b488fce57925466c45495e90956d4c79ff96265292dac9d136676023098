I"Å<p>About halfway through the summer, so I thought I should do some updates! (finally)</p>
<p>
    In addition to working with multiple freelance projects, I've been busy with Google Summer of Code, under Ruby on Rails.. I'll probably write a full blogpost about
  that after this summer period.
</p>
<p>
  I have also picked up drawing as a new hobby! I spend a few hours everyday either practicing my perspective drawing or studying references. I really hope to be able to have at least
  a simple drawing out by the end of summer which I can be proud of showing to everyone. Until then, it's basically practice, practice, practice..
  The eyes I draw still look funny, the head proportions sometimes go wacky.. but hey, nothing like a journey fraught with mistakes and lessons to
  improve our own capabilities right?
  <br />
  This is also the first time I felt such a fervent drive towards a hobby too. And I bet it will last for a <i>very</i> long time.
