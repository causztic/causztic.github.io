I"è<p>Just came back home from a meeting with the first club I've joined in SUTD (even though I am officially not a student yet :p)</p>
<p>Really excited to teach the stuff I know to people who are genuinely interested, and to tackle and learn new technologies with like-minded folk! Can't wait to get started.</p>
<p>We are starting to teach everyone in the club how to use Git next Thursday, and we'll move on from there. Building a brand new website for the team too! Woo I'm pumped.</p>
