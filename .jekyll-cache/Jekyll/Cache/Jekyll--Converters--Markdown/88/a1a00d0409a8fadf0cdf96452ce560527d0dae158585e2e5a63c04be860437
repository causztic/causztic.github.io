  It has been a roller-coaster ride of a 2017, and with the new year creeping in a few days ago, I thought I should update the website
  more frequently.. and what better way to start other than a recap?

  Internship interviews and worrying about failing Physics really took up the first few months.I was also working on
  another start-up project at the same time, which after looking back, I wished I didn't take up. I ended up accepting
  a position at an big-data analytics start-up, which I have totally no idea about.. which is a good thing! What other way to
  spend your internship period other than learning new things, and diving into the deep end of the pool without (much) repercussions?
