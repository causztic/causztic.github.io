I"@<p>I received an email last Friday about a limited time only specialÂ offer for plane tickets to various places, and saw that the Business Class flight to Osaka was only $250. $250! So my friend and I immediately bought the tickets at night, with only 2 remaining seats.</p>
<p>Phew!</p>
<p>This time around, the trip is a totally different ball game; we are travelling for a longer period of time over a larger scale and staying at multiple places!</p>
<p>Now I need to book the places to sleep, trawl through the different possible train routes to find the best line-of-fit and get. winter. gear. The last time I went to South Korea I used my Dad's leather gloves and his balaclava(!) in replacement of mittens and beanie..</p>
<p>I feel like I should get decent gear this time around! And I can't wait.</p>
<p>21 days to go!</p>
