I"T<p>I moved from Heroku to Openshift because Heroku was killing the free tier (and I was just practicing my Ruby On Rails).</p>
<p>Then I moved to DigitalOcean from Openshift because Openshift kept complaining I was running out of memory and the server crashes quite often..(perhaps of logrotation?)</p>
<p>And now I'm at Wordpress from DigitalOcean because $5 a month seems overkill for a blog and an experimental website..I'll move grafiore.ninja off to my Pi when I have the time and run it when it is turned on I guess!</p>
<p>It's all about dat money savings!</p>
