I"¼<p>Just received my Physics and Chemistry papers back and realised I barely scraped passes.<br />
I... am feeling this distinct sourness on my chest, and I don't know what to do right now. I think my polytechnic days lifted me higher than what I should be, and now I'm crashing down to reality. Maybe I am not a smart person after all, and there was the veil of delusion cast upon me.</p>
<p>Should I pressÂ on? ( Well I guess I have to. )</p>
