    Travelshopa is a website for users to discover fashion and shopping in little-known places. Converted the site from Wordpress to a full-fledged Ruby on Rails application, with updated design and added features.

    Fun client to work with! The website also appeared on The Business Times so I'm rather happy with that.

    I've joined Bandwagon as a full-time web developer. I merged their editorial, gig finder and advertisement services across three servers and databases, and I've also improved the website SEO and got it a new look with the help of the team!

    It was fun to get influenced by new musics and working closely with Singapore's music industry to cater to a targetted audience and learning UX along the way.
